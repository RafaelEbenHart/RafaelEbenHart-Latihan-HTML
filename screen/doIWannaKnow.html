        <p>Have you got colour in your cheeks?</p>
        <p>Do you ever get that fear that you can't shift the type</p>
        <p>That sticks around like summat in your teeth?</p>
        <p>Are there some aces up your sleeve?</p>
        <p>Have you no idea that you're in deep?</p>
        <p>I've dreamt about you nearly every night this week</p>
        <p>How many secrets can you keep?</p>
        <p>'Cause there's this tune I found</p>
        <p>That makes me think of you somehow an' I play it on repeat</p>
        <p>Until I fall asleep, spillin' drinks on my settee</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>(Do I wanna know?) If this feelin' flows both ways?</p>
        <p>(Sad to see you go) Was sorta hopin' that you'd stay</p>
        <p>(Baby, we both know) That the nights were mainly made</p>
        <p>For sayin' things that you can't say tomorrow day</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Crawlin' back to you</p>
        <p>Ever thought of callin' when</p>
        <p>You've had a few?</p>
        <p>'Cause I always do</p>
        <p>Maybe I'm too</p>
        <p>Busy bein' yours</p>
        <p>To fall for somebody new</p>
        <p>Now, I've thought it through</p>

        <p>So have you got the guts?</p>
        <p>Been wonderin' if your heart's still open</p>
        <p>And if so, I wanna know what time it shuts</p>
        <p>Simmer down an' pucker up, I'm sorry to interrupt</p>
        <p>It's just I'm constantly on the cusp of tryin' to kiss you</p>
        <p>But I don't know if you feel the same as I do</p>
