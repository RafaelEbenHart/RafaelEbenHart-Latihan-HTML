        <h1>NO 1 PARTY ANTHEM</h1>
        <p>So you're on the prowl wondering whether</p>
        <p>She left already or not</p>
        <p>Leather jacket, collar popped like Cantona</p>
        <p>Never knowing when to stop</p>
        <p>Sunglasses indoor is par for the course</p>
        <p>Lights in the floors and sweat on the walls</p>
        <p>Cages and poles</p>
        <p>Call off the search for your soul</p>
        <p>Or put it on hold again</p>
        <p>She's having a sly indoor smoke</p>
        <p>And she calls the folks who run this, her oldest friends</p>
        <p>Sipping a drink and laughing at imaginary jokes</p>
        <p>As all the signals are sent, her eyes invite you to approach</p>
        <p>And it seems as though those lumps in your throat</p>
        <p>That you just swallowed have got you going</p>
        <p>Come on, come on, come on</p>
        <p>Come on, come on, come on</p>
        <p>Number one party anthem</p>
        <p>She's a certified mind blower</p>
        <p>Knowing full, well, that I don't</p>
        <p>May suggest there's somewhere from which I might know her</p>
        <p>Just to get the ball to roll</p>
        <p>Drunken monologues, confused because</p>
        <p>It's not like I'm falling in love, I just want ya</p>
        <p>To do me no good</p>
        <p>And you look like you could</p>
        <p>Come on, come on, come on</p>
        <p>Come on, come on, come on</p>
        <p>Number one party anthem</p>
        <p>Come on, come on, come on</p>
        <p>Before the moment's gone</p>
        <p>Number one party anthem, yeah, yeah</p>
        <p>The look of love, the rush of blood</p>
        <p>The "She's with me" is the Gallic shrug</p>
        <p>The shutterbugs, the Camera Plus</p>
        <p>The black and white and the color dodge</p>
        <p>The good time girls, the cubicles</p>
        <p>The house of fun, the number one</p>
        <p>Party anthem, oh</p>
        <p>Come on, come on, come on</p>
        <p>Come on, come on, come on</p>
        <p>Come on, come on, come on</p>
        <p>Come on, come on, come on</p>
        <p>Before the moment's gone</p>
        <p>Number one party anthem</p>
        <p>Number one party anthem</p>
        <p>Number one party anthem</p>
        <p>Yeah, yeah</p>
